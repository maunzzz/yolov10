# Automatic Video Editor

Tooling built on yolo10 to edit videos automatically

## Installation
Note: Original yolo10 repo uses conda, I prefer virtualenv. So far, it seems to work
```
mkvirtualenv --python=python3.9 ave
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```
